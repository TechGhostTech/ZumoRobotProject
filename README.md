# ZumoRobotProject

- Chosen the object detection algorithm as one 360-degree spin. The zumo robot is placed in 
a certain point after that scan process starts and zumo scans a single 360-degree tour to determine 
number of objects. Time spent during object scanning is approximately 5 and a half seconds. The 
scanning time is chosen 5 and a half seconds due to not miss any objects. The given times and 360-
degree spin are observed when batteries are nearly full and experimental observations can alter if 
the battery level is changed.
